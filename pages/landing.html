  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

  <p>
      JobKit brings together data resources from across the Federal Government to help software developers, developers and communities leaders to better serve the American worker.
  </p>
  <p>
      Federal agencies produce timely, comprehensive, and trusted data on the U.S. labor market. Federal data on national job openings, local labor forces, educational attainment and outcomes, and labor market dynamics can fuel dynamic new data products and services that guide Americans as they build the skills they need to live the life they want. The data and tools equally guide businesses as they invest in good jobs that provide workers the opportunity for advancement and provide communities a strong foundation.

  <h2 id="value">Value and Use Cases</h2>

  <p>
      Today’s skills crisis is exacerbated by the lack of information in the hands of students, workers, parents, and even educational and business leaders about the nexus between learning, worker skills, and work.  Individuals—especially those who lack mentors—seeks outside guidance and counseling on how to reach a successful education-to-work path.  An increasing amount of public and private data can provide the market signals about the nexus between education and careers.  These data can provide assurances about the education and training investments that individuals, educational institutions, and businesses are making.
  </p>
  <p>
      In the hands of developers, high-value individual data sets can be combined into powerful new tools that lead to better more cost-effective decisions about which jobs to take, which skills to acquire, which businesses to attract, and where to establish new businesses..  
  </p>
  <p>
      The best ideas come from those who understand the challenges facing local workforces and communities.  Today’s local leaders and our top software developers share a common characteristic:  they are problem solvers.  Together, these problem sovlers will find ways to make our labor market more transparent to all. 
  </p>
  <p>
      Here are some of the challenges facing today’s workforce across the country:
    <ul> 
      <li>
        Labor Force Participation: After the great recession, many people fell out of the workforce. Can we help bring people back to work?   
      </li>
    <li>
      Wage Growth: Wages for workers are starting to grow, but can we do more to help match workers with high paying jobs? Can we help them increase their earning potential by developing in demand skills? 
    </li> 
    <li>
      Productivity & Dynamism: How can we leverage advances in technology to increase productivity? 
    </li>
    <li>Automation: New technologies are going to change the jobs of the future, what can we do now to prepare? 
    </li>
    <li>Earning Potential: Can a student evaluate the demand and earning potential for a career before investing in time and resources in a training program?
      </li>
    </ul>

      Solving our nation’s workforce challenges starts with civic and data leaders who seek partnerships to serve their communities. Since 2016, The Opportunity Project at the Census Bureau has been providing the expertise and tools for facilitate collaborative, user-centered technology development sprints. 
  </p>
  <p>
      The Opportunity Project is a process for engaging government, communities, and the technology industry to create digital tools that address our greatest challenges as a nation. This process helps to empower people with technology, make government data more accessible and user-friendly, and facilitate cross-sector collaboration to build new digital solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
      The 2018 Opportunity Project cohort will soon complete its sprint at the February 6 Demo Day.  It will include tools that use AI to connect veterans to apprenticeships, promote access to and interest in STEM fields, and help states develop education report cards.
  </p>
  <p>
      The 2019 cohort will begin its sprint soon.  If you have an idea for how to use workforce data to benefit your community, or if you are a developer looking for the chance to serve, consider applying to the Opportunity Project. To learn more:
