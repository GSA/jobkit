  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

  <p>
    JobKit brings together data resources from across the Federal Government helping software developers and community leaders to better serve the American worker.
  </p>
  <p>
      Federal agencies produce timely, comprehensive, and trusted data on the U.S. labor market. Federal data on national job openings, labor force at the local level, educational attainment and outcomes, and labor market dynamics can fuel dynamic new data products and services that guide Americans as they build the skills they need to live the life they want. The data and tools equally guide businesses as they invest in good jobs that provide workers the opportunity for advancement and provide communities a strong foundation.

  <h2 id="value">Value and Use Cases</h2>

  <p>
      Today’s skills gap and jobs gap are exacerbated by inadequate information about the nexus between learning, skills, and work in the hands of the people who need it most - students, workers, parents, educators, trainers, and even business leaders.  Whether they’re looking for their first job or a better job, and whether they are guided by a career counselor or on their own, everyone needs information on how to navigate a successful learning-to-work path and pathways beyond the first job.  How can we leverage the increasingly available public and private data to provide the market signals about the nexus between education, training, apprentiships, and careers.  Presented properly, these data can inform the education and training investments made by individuals, educational institutions, and businesses.
  </p>
  <p>
      In the hands of developers, high-value individual data sets can be combined into powerful new tools that lead to smarter and more cost-effective decisions about which jobs to take, which skills to acquire, which businesses to attract, and where to establish new businesses. 
  </p>
  <p>
      The best ideas come from those who understand the challenges facing local workforces and communities.  Today’s local leaders and our top software developers share a common characteristic:  &nbsp;they are problem solvers.  Together, these problem solvers will find ways to make our labor market more transparent to all. 
  </p>
  <p>
      Here are some of the challenges facing today’s workforce across the country:
    <ul class="usa-list"> 
      <li>
        Labor Force Participation: After the great recession, many people fell out of the workforce. Can we help bring people back to work?   
      </li>
    <li>
      Wage Growth: Wages for workers are starting to grow, but can we do more to help match workers with high paying jobs? Can we help them increase their earning potential by developing in demand skills? 
    </li> 
    <li>
      Productivity & Dynamism: How can we leverage advances in technology to increase productivity? 
    </li>
    <li>Automation: New technologies are going to change the jobs of the future, what can we do now to prepare? 
    </li>
    <li>Earning Potential: Can a student evaluate the demand and earning potential for a career before investing time and resources in a training program?
      </li>
    </ul>

        <p>
            This API lets developers customize Census Bureau statistics into web or mobile apps that provide users quick and easy access from an ever increasing pool of publicly available datasets. Currently available statistics provide key demographic and economic information on the nation, its neighborhoods and areas in between. These data are currently used to distribute around $400 billion in Federal, State, and local funds in ways that help communities plan for schools, social and emergency services, highway improvements, and economic developments.

  <p>
      Solving our nation’s workforce challenges starts with civic and data leaders who seek partnerships to serve their communities. Since 2016, The Opportunity Project at the Census Bureau has been providing the expertise and tools to facilitate collaborative, user-centered technology development sprints. 
  </p>
  <p>
      The Opportunity Project is a process for engaging government, communities, and the technology industry to create digital tools that address our greatest challenges as a nation. This process helps to empower people with technology, make government data more accessible and user-friendly, and facilitate cross-sector collaboration to build new digital solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
      The 2018 Opportunity Project cohort will soon complete its sprint at the March 1 Demo Day.  It will include tools that use AI to connect veterans to apprenticeships, promote access to and interest in STEM fields, and help states develop education report cards.
  </p>
  <p>
      The 2019 cohort will begin its sprint soon.  If you have an idea for how to use workforce data to benefit your community, or if you are a developer looking for the chance to serve, consider applying to the Opportunity Project. To learn more:
